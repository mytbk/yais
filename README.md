Introduction
============
These are the brief steps for archlinux installing:      
1. Select an editor      
2. partitioning and mounting      
3. Select a mirror      
4. Test the internet      
5. install basic packages (with linux,grub)      
6. chroot to install grub      
7. generate fstab

This script uses a text interface to lead you finishing
